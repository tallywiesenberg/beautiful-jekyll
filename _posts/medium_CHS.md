## Introduction

Homelessness, inequality, poverty — Anyone who has walked around Manhattan in 2019 for more than 30 minutes has encountered these social issues on the streets of the city where we once believed the American Dream was most alive. Everyone will agree that they are deeply upsetting, and almost everyone will agree that they feel powerless to this injustice.

Even on a grander scale, Americans will agree that depression is a large, close-to-home problem in the United States. [Half of Americans have been personally affected by suicide in some way](https://adaa.org/survey-finds-americans-value-mental-health-and-physical-health-equally), showing that no one is too far removed from the ramifications of poor mental health.

In urban domains, public health officials often approach physical ailments from a human geography perspective, examining correlations between socio-economics, demographics, and health indicators such as exercise and addiction. This approach begs a similar, but more novel question: how does public health influence *mental *health? Could certain attributes of a neighborhood’s health — role models, poverty, community inclusivity — predict the mental health of its constituents?

## Key Question

How does *public *health influence *mental *health?

## Dataset

The New York City Department of Public Health’s [Community Health Survey](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/data-sets/community-health-survey-public-use-data.page) (CHS) is a random telephone survey that has collected regional data on mental and physical health, household economic data, and community strength across the sheer racial, social, and economic diversity of the region.

CHS asks each respondent the eight standardized questions which make up [Personal Health Questionnaire 8 (PHQ8), a clinically standard diagnostic tool for Major Depressive Disorder](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18752852). An example form is attached below.

What makes CHS unique is that, in addition to asking the PHQ8 questionnaire, the survey asks New Yorkers to consider the quality of life in their neighborhood.

## Analysis

In order to evaluate the relationship between neighborhood health and individual health, I first examined the prevalence of depression severity among those who answered the following questions:

### How Would You Describe Your Food Security Situation?

About 10 percent of respondents who reported not having enough to eat in their household also qualified for severe depression. **More than half of those reporting this level of food insecurity also qualified for depression of any severity.**

### Have You Experienced Discriminatory Healthcare Treatment in the Past 12 Months?

A similar pattern emerges with discriminatory healthcare treatment. About 5 percent of respondents who reported experiencing discriminatory healthcare treatment also reported severe depression, and **about half of those who reported yes qualified for a depression diagnosis of any severity.**

## Conclusion

Depression is a very serious disease, oftentimes crippling those who suffer from it. Furthermore, the risk of suicide can destroy families and livelihoods.

Many assume that the distribution of depression in the American population is random or genetic. Rather, the results of this analysis point to a different hypothesis: while this analysis cannot assert that food insecurity and healthcare discrimination *cause *depression, the results point to **a correlation between environmental factors such as food insecurity and discriminatory healthcare treatment and depression.**

About 50 percent of New York City’s food-insecure citizens are depressed. 10 percent are severely depressed. I hypothesize that an inability to secure one’s basic needs facilitates depression and a sense of hopelessness.

The prevalence of severe depression among the food-insecure is simply disproportionate, which presents the idea that mental health can be a justice issue as obesity and smoking are.
