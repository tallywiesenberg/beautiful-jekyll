subtitle: The story of my Data Science career
---

My name is Tally Wiesenberg, and I am currently studying Data Science and Machine Learning at Lambda School. I am 20 years old, and I am fascinated by philosophy and social studies fields such as geography, sociology, and psychology. My goal is to apply my Machine Learning skills to the Social Sciences, and test the hypotheses of great philosophers with big data.
