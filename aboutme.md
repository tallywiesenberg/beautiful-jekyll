subtitle: The story of my Data Science career
---

My name is Tally Wiesenberg, and I am currently studying Data Science and Machine Learning at Lambda School. I am 20 years old, and I am fascinated by philosophy and social studies fields such as geography, sociology, and psychology. My goal is to apply my Machine Learning skills to study public health in urban communities.
